This paper proposes a novel incentive methodTiFedCrowd for the federated crowdsourcing scenario where workers participate in federated learning tasks under a privacy protection condition. TiFedCrowd models the federated crowdsourcing process where the server interacts with multiple clients as a two-stage Stackelberg game. At the same time,  a time control mechanism is brought in TiFedCrowd, which restricts the time for clients to complete and submit federated crowdsourcing tasks. The time control mechanism not only initially filters out low-quality data/models but also allows the data requester to keep the data fresh and keep the maximum waiting time within an acceptable limit. This paper derives the Nash equilibrium of the two-stage Stackelberg game to obtain a global optimal solution, which makes the clients and the server in the competition maximize their utility concurrently. The TiFedCrowd method is easy to be extended to a multiple heterogeneous federated crowdsourcing scenario and still maintains its global optimal characteristics. A large number of experiments have demonstrated that TiFedCrowd can facilitate crowd workers to efficiently complete federated learning tasks with high quality using the smallest possible budget and within the deadline provided by the data/model requester. In the future, we will...
